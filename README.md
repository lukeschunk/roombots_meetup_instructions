# roombots_meetup_instructions

Tonight We're going to be writing javascript to control roombots. :robot_face:  This will help get you up and running. 

### Clone down the Repos 

There is a node based repo and a browser based repo. In these instructions I'll be referencing the node version, but both are pretty similar. Clone down the repo of your choice. If you use the node version, make sure you have node installed on your machine. 

Node Repo: https://github.com/paniclater/node_roombot

Browser: https://github.com/mmmries/browser_roombot

Open up the repo in your favorite editor. 

### Navigate to the Simulator

The simulator is where you'll practice connecting and controlling the roombot. Simulator: http://roombots.riesd.com/simulations/0FtkPQ==?maze=empty 

### Connect your app to the simulator

If you're using the Node Repo, run `npm install`. Copy and paste the IP and channel from the simulator to your app.
